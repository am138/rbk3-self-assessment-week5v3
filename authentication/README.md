- Commit with th comment "passwords"

- Plaintext passwords : hacker can access database and get password easyly because password didnt encrypted


- Encrypted passwords :  reversible password , hacker can take the password and reversible it again 


- Hashed passwords : irreversible password , the origin password cant recover , this way is the best one because the hacker cant encrypt the password

in hash the origin password add to it salt (character that add to origin password before hashed)
