## Authentication
- Explain why each system fails (hacked), and how to guard against that failure when using the follwoing types of passwords:
- Commit with th comment "passwords"

- Plaintext passwords


- Encrypted passwords:
in this type we can use very defacult encypt logarithm by using to types of encryption
first is the hashing and second is using salt code for every password so you by this to types
we make our passwords more secure and more defaculty than just hashing to decrypt because the hacker has to use 
two logarithms of decryption and every password take a lot of time.  


- Hashed passwords
in this way we using hashing to encrypt our passwords and we save it hashed in the database
and maby every password well convert to 32 bit of numbers and charrecters so the hacker well take
a lot of time to decrypt every password.
