## Authentication
- Explain why each system fails (hacked), and how to guard against that failure when using the follwoing types of passwords:
- Commit with th comment "passwords"

- Plaintext passwords:
	This one is the easiest on to hack becaues it offer nearly zero protection against hacking,
	the passowrd can easly guessed by hacking programs that depends on trying and failing without 
	any decription.


- Encrypted passwords
	This one will fail easily if the hacker figuered out the encription method, you can increase
	the protection by making multiple stages of encryption.

- Hashed passwords
	This one have the opportunity to give multiple passwords the same hashing, to solve this you
	can use salt to add a random characters to the beginning of the password.
