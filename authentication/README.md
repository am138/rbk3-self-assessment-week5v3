## Authentication
- Explain why each system fails (hacked), and how to guard against that failure when using the follwoing types of passwords:
- Commit with th comment "passwords"

- Plaintext passwords
Plaintext passwords are not secure because it is not encrypted so the hackers can access the passwords like the man in the middle attak or  other hacking attaks. We can enhance the security of this type of passwords firstly by using encryption system then by usung a strong and not repeated  password.


- Encrypted passwords
  This type of passwords is more secure than the previos one bus it can faile foe many resons like some times usung  a week enciption algorithm so the hacker can decrypt the pass word after doing some complicated calculation on the pass word.We can also enhance the security of this type by using a strong encription algorithms for example AES.


- Hashed passwords
  the hashed pass words are strong but what will happen if the hacker accessed the hash function then he can not only access the password bus also he can access all pass words hashed with the same hashing function.
