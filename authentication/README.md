## Authentication
- Explain why each system fails (hacked), and how to guard against that failure when using the follwoing types of passwords:
- Commit with th comment "passwords"

- Plaintext passwords
  it's bad and the hacker can hacked, because we didn't deploy any change in the password so any hacker can enter the database from backdoor or employee in company can know the password in easy way because it's the same password. 

- Encrypted passwords

encripted password it's more secure but also can hacked because when you want to creat hash password it generate key and stored in database ,hacker when he interd to databse and know the key he can know the orginal password. 


- Hashed passwords
it's the best in security it deploy hash algorithm in password and convert each char or number so yo can't know the orginal password
