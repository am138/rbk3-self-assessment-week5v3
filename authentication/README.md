- Explain why each system fails (hacked), and how to guard against that failure when using the follwoing types of passwords:
- Commit with th comment "passwords"

- Plaintext passwords
it's a normal text like any name or word and it's saved without any changes and it'll be easy to brok or to hack

- Encrypted passwords
a system used to save the password in way like <code Encryption >
