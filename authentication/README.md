## Authentication
- Explain why each system fails (hacked), and how to guard against that failure when using the follwoing types of passwords:

- Commit with the comment "passwords"
    because when we commentt as passwords any one from the hackers can know where we saved  the data in database so , any hacker can easily know where is the passwords exactly .
    so we can comment in hash way so no one understand the comment expect us.

- Plaintext passwords
    it's so easy to go to any text file and fetch the value from it so we can use 
    we can use (.sql) text ;

- Encrypted passwords
    it's a good way to save passwords but stil hackers can some how to go throw the db 
    and get passwords from it we can use hashing to make more encrypted 


- Hashed passwords
it's the best way to save passwords and the most encrybted way 
but maybe for some reason the passwords didn't hashed or hashing was so easy to guess
so we can make sure from DB the passwords is hashed .
