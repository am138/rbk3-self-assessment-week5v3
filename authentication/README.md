## Authentication
- Explain why each system fails (hacked), and how to guard against that failure when using the follwoing types of passwords:
- Commit with th comment "passwords"


- Plaintext passwords
this type of password hacked easily because the hacker can hack the database which contains the list of passwords and show the plaintext 
easily and maybe eavasdropper can intercept the message and read the 
plain text easily.

- Encrypted passwords
this type of password hacked because each encryption method has 
decryption method to get the orginal text . 

- Hashed passwords
this type is best type to use beacause it's very defficult to 
get the orginl text if you don't have a key .
