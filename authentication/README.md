## Authentication
- Explain why each system fails (hacked), and how to guard against that failure when using the follwoing types of passwords:
- Commit with th comment "passwords"
      it's easy to hack , becouse it hasent any type of secure so we can reach to the password easly 

- Plaintext passwords
      also it dosen't has any type of secure so we can reach to the password direct 

- Encrypted passwords
      it's secure becouse if the hacker reach to the password he will see somthing encrypted and dosen't match the real password 
      (create somthing diffrent than the real with another charachter and numbers with diffrent size of the real password)
      example esraa = adkjdskds45sdsds

- Hashed passwords
      it's secured , if the hacker reach to the password he will see somthing diffrent than the real password 
      (create somthing diffrent than the real password with same size of password )
      example esraa = gutcc
