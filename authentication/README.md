## Authentication
- Explain why each system fails (hacked), and how to guard against that failure when using the follwoing types of passwords:
- Commit with the comment "passwords"

- Plaintext passwords. 
 * I think because if you get access to this method you will get access to every passward and user name of every user for this system.

- Encrypted passwords
;) I forget

- Hashed passwords
*I think because you can't get the origin string again. only you can get the collision, I remember that we can counteract this by salt method.
